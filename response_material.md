## The Specific Questions Asked In the RFI
*[copy and paste individual questions along with your responses into your email response]*

### Section A. Information Gaps and Needs in Accessing Current Data and Aid Programs

*Section A, Question 1*: How could data sets that are already publicly available be made more accessible using APIs? Are there specific data sets that are already available that would be most likely to inform consumer choice about college affordability and performance?  
*Section A, Question 2*: How could APIs help people with successfully and accurately completing forms associated with any of the following processes: FAFSA; Master Promissory Note; Loan Consolidation; entrance and exit counseling; Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) programs, such as Pay As You Earn; and the Public Student Loan Forgiveness program?  
*Section A, Question 3*: What gaps are there with loan counseling and financial literacy and awareness that could be addressed through the use of APIs to provide access to government resources and content?

### Section D. Technical Specifications

*Section D, Question 1*: What elements would a read-write API need to include for successful use at the Department?  
*Section D, Question 2*: What data, methods, and other features must an API contain in order to develop apps accessing Department data or enhancing Department processes, programs, or services?  
*Section D, Question 3*: How would read-only and/or read-write APIs interact with or modify the performance of the Department's existing systems (e.g., FAFSA on the Web)? Could these APIs negatively or positively affect the current operating capability of such systems? Would these APIs allow for the flexibility to evolve seamlessly with the Department's technological developments?  
*Section D, Question 4*: What vulnerabilities might read-write APIs introduce for the security of the underlying databases the Department currently uses?
